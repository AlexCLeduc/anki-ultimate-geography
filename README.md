The deck features:

**All flags are in SVG format**, sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags),
and optimised for smaller file size. The maps are from the original deck (cf. [Background](#background) section below); although most
of them are great, some lack consistency and clarity... but [I'm working on it](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/issues/1).

Additional information is provided on some cards such as:
- similar flags (e.g. Iceland: _Norway (red background, blue cross)_)
- governance information (e.g. Cayman Islands: _Overseas territory of the United Kingdom_)
- alternative or former country names (e.g. East Timor: _Also known as Timer-Leste_)
- additional capitals (executive or de facto only - e.g. Sucre, Bolivia: _While Sucre is the constitutional capital, La Paz is the seat of government._)
- statehood information (e.g. Transnistria: _Independent state claimed by Moldova_).

The following **tags** are available to create filtered decks (cd. [Advanced use](#advanced-use) section below):

- `UG::Sovereign_State`
- `UG::Oceans+Seas`
- `UG::Africa`, `UG::America`, `UG::Asia`, `UG::Europe`, `UG::Oceania`
- `UG::North+Central_America`, `UG::South_America`, `UG::Caribbean`, `UG::Middle_East`, `UG::Southeast_Asia`, `UG::European_Union`


## Getting started

1. Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/releases) page** and find the latest release.
2. Download the `Ultimate_Geography.apkg` package provided.
3. Open it with Anki.

That's all there is to it!

- If you spot a mistake or have a suggestion, please don't hesitate to **[raise an issue](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/issues)**.
- If you wish to stay informed of new releases, watch this repository or subscribe to the [releases feed]:

- Before updating the deck to a new version, check out the release notes for special instructions.


## Background

This deck is built on top of an existing [shared deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/261823898).
My initial goal was to resolve some of the issues mentioned in the comments such as the poor quality of the flags,
but I ended up doing _a lot_ more, including putting the deck up on GitHub, rethinking the tags, and reviewing
all the content. For a full list of changes, check out the [initial release notes](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/releases/tag/v2.0).


## Advanced use

First and foremost, please **beware that customising the deck may make it more challenging to update in the future**.

All notes are based on a **single note type** named _Ultimate Geography_, and the cards are automatically generated by Anki
based on **four templates**: _Country > Capital_, _Capital > Country_, _Flag > Country_ and _Map > Country_.
The note type contains **eight fields**: _Country_, _Country info_, _Capital_, _Capital info_, _Capital hint_,
_Flag_, _Flag similarity_ and _Map_. If this is not enough for you and you wish to learn more about each country
(e.g. currency, language, largest city, etc.), simply add more fields and templates.

All fields are free from HTML formatting. The appearance of the cards is controlled solely with CSS,
in the note templates. Feel free to customise the styles to your liking (e.g. bold country names,
larger flags, etc.)

All tags are **prefixed with `UG::`** to prevent conflicts with other geography decks.
It also allows them to be grouped in the sidebar of the Anki card browser thanks to the
[Hierarchical Tags](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1089921461) add-on.

Anki's powerful [filtering feature](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#searching), along with the deck's comprehensive tag structure, allows for creating filtered decks
for a wide range of learning goals and levels:
- use the note type filter to focus on a specific type of question - e.g. `card:"Flag > Country"`
- use the tag filter to focus on a specific continent or region of the world - e.g. `tag:"UG::Africa"`
- use `tag:"Sovereign_State"` to include only sovereign states and exclude many of the Caribbean and Pacific islands
- use `-tag:"Oceans+Seas"` if you're not interested in learning oceans and seas
- combine the filters above to create more specific or generic decks (with the keyword `or`).


## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, especially when it comes to fixing mistakes and adding missing information.
The easiest way to help is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/issues).
If it's small enough, I'll get onto it asap and you won't have to do anything (except download the updated package).
If you really feel like doing it yourself, keep reading this section. Even then, I strongly recommend that you 
raise an issue _before_ you start doing any work, as not all contributions are welcome (read the guidelines below).

### Guidelines

This deck aims at supporting learners of **all levels**. It should not be too overwhelming to beginners out of the box,
while still challenging enough for more advanced learners. Similarly, the deck should suit both users who are and aren't
familiar with Anki's advanced features (filtered decks, note templates, tags, etc.)

What this means concretely:

- The deck is exhaustive in some aspects but not all: it covers all of the world's 206 sovereign states
but will never include every overseas territory, dependent region and other geographical or political area on the planet.
- The deck will most likely never have more note templates than it currently has: most people
aren't interested in learning each country's currency for instance (at least initially), so having cards for this in the deck
out of the box would risk scaring many of them away (especially beginner Anki users).
- The previous point doesn't mean, however, that the notes can't contain more fields. This would give advanced users
the freedom to create their own note templates. Contributions welcome! :blush:
- All notes must be tagged appropriately so users can create filtered decks to suit their learning process.
- The tags should remain in limited number for clarity. A tag may be added if it:
  - applies to a reasonable number of notes (not to low, not to high)
  - contains a significantly different set of notes from every other tag, and
  - solves a relatively common learning use case.


### Workflow

> If you're new to GitHub and contributing, [read this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) first.

This deck is maintained with [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778), an add-on for Anki 
that lets you import and export decks in a JSON format to facilitate maintenance and community contribution.
Here is what the typical contribution process looks like:

1. Fork and clone this repository on your machine and create a new branch.
2. Install the CrowdAnki add-on and restart Anki.
3. In the _File_ menu, select _CrowdAnki: Import from disk_.
4. Browse for and select the _Ultimate\_Geography_ folder.
5. Make your changes to the deck.
6. From the _Decks_ screen, select the deck's _Export_ option
7. Choose _CrowdAnki Json representation_ as the export format, make sure the _Include media_ checkbox is ticked and click _Export..._
8. Browse for and select the folder in which you cloned this repository.
9. Commit your changes and open a Pull Request with a meaningful description.

> Alternatively, for _very_ small changes, you can edit the JSON file straight from GitHub.


### Versioning

The releases follow a versioning scheme of the form `x.y`, where:

- `x` indicates a breaking release - i.e. a release that contains structural changes that would break the import of the deck for existing users or reset their progress
- `y` indicates a non-breaking release - e.g. when a card is added or removed, when a new tag is created, when an image is changed, etc.

> Note that the initial release is `v2.0`, as a way to distinguish this deck from its predecessor, which was labeled `v1.0`.
