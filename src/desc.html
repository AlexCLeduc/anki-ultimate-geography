This deck is built on top of an existing <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/261823898">shared deck</a>. My initial goal was to resolve some of the issues mentioned in the comments such as the poor quality of the flags, but I ended up doing <i>a lot</i> more, including putting the deck up on GitHub, rethinking the tags, and reviewing all of the content. For a full list of changes, check out the <a href="https://github.com/axelboc/anki-ultimate-geography/releases/tag/v2.0">initial release notes</a>.
